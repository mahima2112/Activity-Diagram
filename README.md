Description of the problem:

There will be a search page.
After hitting search, you can see the details about the restaurant whether it is open or closed based upon its timings.
For details, you can see the menu which includes all the items along with their prices.
The user can add items and check the total money that they would be spending.
You get an error if there are no search results.
